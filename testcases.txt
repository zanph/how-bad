verifying zipcode detector:
   48108, 60187, 60612, 94117 (all valid)
malformed zipcodes:
   01953, 954659, 0125, 193 (all detected as such)

city + country:
   Paris,FR, San Francisco,US, Chicago,US (all detected)

city:
   Paris, San Francisco (both report there are too many cities, and to specify country code)

Strange bugs:
   $$$aaa yields Washington, DC. URL sent to API:  http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?zip=7855%2CUS
   99999 and 3125 yield DC as well
      3125 URL: http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?zip=3125%2CUS
      99999 URL: http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?zip=99999%2CUS

   this is probably a bug in the API or perhaps a design decision by the API developers themselves

   I need to add regex to automatically reject out of hand any query containing special characters (!@#$%^&*()[]}{)
      etc
